      <p class="job_text">Working under a VP of Sales for Kenmar, I gained experience with product management through the
      assisting of quality control of shipped parts. I created presentations for the company to
        acquire and retain customers as well as, work on quality management deliverables for the company.
        I updated their website when they needed help with upkeep, and was able to spend time working on
      company logistics for parts coming from all over the world.</p>

      <p class="job_text">Having received the Evans Scholarship to the University of Michigan, I wanted to give back to the
      Western Golf Association and my fellow scholars by running for the office of VP of Finance. My peers
      elected me into the office and I then managed all the budget, bills, cable, internet, and any other duties
      that arose from being on the house's executive board. This was no small task when living with 63 people
      and running a budget of $120,000 independently, but I am proud that I was able to effectively serve my
      peers and maintain the house during my time in office.</p>

      <p class="job_text">For the Volvik Championship, prior to the tournament, I created graphics and fliers
        for the tournament,
      got volunteers and guests to sign up to help with and attend the event, and got the golf course prepared
      for the numerous people who would be on the course throughout the week. During the tournament, I was
      in charge of the will call office as well as worked as point man for the
      admissions and ticket sales department. I also worked in keeping players, Golf Channel, LPGA
      officials, and esteemed guests happy during their time in Ann Arbor. Putting in over 100 hours of work
        the week of the tournament shows my commitment to my work. Also, as my superiors saw my work ethic
        and ability as a leader throughout the week, they recognized me as the head intern and their most
      trusted worker.</p>
